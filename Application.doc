-- Database migrations codes if you are not familiar with EntityFrameWork Core

In  IntradayDashboard.Infrastructure path you can youse these codes => .

    dotnet ef database drop => drop db
    dotnet ef database create "dbname" => create db

    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migrations => Create migration classes in Data/Migrations folder

    dotnet ef database update ==> Run latest migration and update db.

-- RabbitMq 

  ** Post Messages are named as "{ObjectName}Message"
  ** Its Consumers Added in StartUp as  services.AddScoped<{ObjectName}Consumer>(); and  
   in AddMassTransit method  => x.AddConsumers(typeof({ObjectName}Consumer)

  ** Its RequestClients added as x.AddRequestClient<{ObjectName}Message>(); in AddMassTransit Method

  -- Hangfire 

  ** I advice to read here => https://docs.hangfire.io/en/latest/background-processing/configuring-queues.html

    Manage your background task in detail. 
    If you need to create new queue, configure it in StartUp.cs by giving new queue names... 
    
     (*/10 * * * *) ==> every ten min  
     (30 9 * * *) => every day at 9.30 am 
     (0 */12 * * *) => every day at 12 am or pm
 ** See the same templates in recurring jobs / Cron column

  -- Seeding 

  ** In Seed folder in infrastructure you can read from json file by deserializing you can insert what ever you want in the start.
